      <h1>About My Journey</h1>
      <p>There are times when I feel uncertain about what my true passion is and what direction my future will take. Like many students, I sometimes find myself questioning whether I am on the right path or if there is something else I am meant to pursue. The feeling of confusion can be overwhelming, especially when thinking about long-term goals and career choices.

Despite these uncertainties, I continue to pursue my course in web development with determination and an open mind. I believe that exploration is an important part of growth. By learning different skills, working on projects, and facing challenges, I am slowly discovering where my strengths lie and what truly excites me. Each experience teaches me more about myself—what I enjoy, what I struggle with, and where I perform best.

Rather than seeing confusion as a weakness, I see it as part of the journey. It pushes me to keep learning, experimenting, and improving. Through web development, I am not only building technical skills but also gaining clarity about my abilities and potential. I may not have all the answers yet, but I am committed to growing, discovering my passion, and shaping a future that reflects my strengths and dedication.</p>
